name: data-analyst
description: Turn datasets into clear, defensible answers, reports and dashboards. Use whenever the user wants to analyze data (CSV, Excel, SQL tables, dataframes, survey or log files), explore an unfamiliar dataset, define metrics/KPIs, explain why a number changed, analyze cohorts, funnels, experiments, surveys or time series, build an early-warning or risk-scoring analysis, or produce an analytical report or dashboard — even if they only say "look at this data" or "what does this tell us". Grills the user one question at a time when consequential context is missing, or when they say "grill me" about an analysis plan. Scales from a one-table answer to a full ten-stage project, and supplies report/dashboard templates, chart styling and statistics helpers.

# Data Analyst

Your product is an answer a busy reader can understand in two minutes and check in ten. Rigor is the floor, not the deliverable: correct populations, denominators and joins make the answer trustworthy, but the reader came for the finding, why it matters and what to do or look at next.

Two failure modes to avoid, both seen in practice:

- **Shallow**: correct totals and a profile of every column, but no real question answered.
- **Defensive**: careful analysis buried under table dumps, caveats on every sentence and process paperwork. The reader cannot find the point.

Aim for careful analysis told plainly.

## Start and scale

1. **Find the purpose and intended use.** Establish who will read this and what they need to decide or learn. Exploratory and informational work can start from its purpose and an inspection of the data and documentation; refine the questions from what they support. Establish a decision, population, grain, units, period and deliverable format when they affect the answer.
2. **Grill when context is missing.** If a decision that would change the answer is still open after that (outcome definition, population, period, cutoff, success criteria, deliverable), interview the user one question at a time using [grilling](./references/grilling.md), with your recommended answer for each. Summarize the settled brief and proceed; ask again only if the summary introduces a new consequential assumption or scope change. Also grill whenever the user asks ("grill me on this analysis"). Do not grill on facts you can look up or on focused calculations. When the user cannot answer (background run, "just do it"), record your recommendations as _proposed_ assumptions instead.
3. **Size the job.**
   - _Focused_ (one calculation, one comparison, a query): inspect the relevant inputs, compute, check once independently, answer with a compact table or a few sentences. No lifecycle headings, dashboard or model.
   - _Substantial_ (open-ended investigation, project, report/dashboard): follow the lifecycle below and read [the lifecycle workflow](./workflows/analytics-lifecycle.md). Check whether a [playbook](#playbooks) matches the problem before planning.
4. **Respect delivery preferences in order.** Follow the user's explicit format or required outline first. Otherwise use existing project or BI tooling. If neither applies, use the bundled report template and add the dashboard template when interactive exploration helps.

## The lifecycle (John Rollins, 10 stages)

Follow this order of reasoning for substantial work. It is iterative: when evidence breaks an earlier decision, go back to that stage and say so. Scale the depth of each stage to the task; the gate is what matters, not a heading in the report.

| # | Stage | Question it answers | Produce | Gate to move on |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Business Understanding | What purpose does this serve, and what decision or learning question matters? | Brief: purpose, reader, questions, scope and deliverable; decision goals and KPIs when relevant | Questions are clear and answerable; decision success criteria are defined when needed |
| 2 | Analytic Approach | How can data answer it? | Analytics type and simplest method per question, with baselines | Method can actually answer the question |
| 3 | Data Requirements | What data do we need? | Outcome + context data → available? answerable / conditional / unsupported | Gaps trigger a narrower question or a pivot, not silence |
| 4 | Data Collection | Where does it come from, how do we get it? | Source inventory: source, coverage, access, sensitivity | Inputs trace to source; privacy handled; gaps disclosed |
| 5 | Data Understanding | Is the data representative of the problem? | Profile, descriptive stats, data quality by dimension | Meanings come from records and docs, not column names |
| 6 | Data Preparation | What work makes it usable? | Cleaned, blended, transformed tables; preparation log with counts | Keys, row counts, denominators and control totals reconcile |
| 7 | Modeling | How do we visualize or model the answer? | Comparisons, challenged hypotheses, models where justified; charts | Each finding has numbers, a comparison and a challenged alternative |
| 8 | Evaluation | Does it really answer the question? | Recomputed key numbers, check ledger, honest status | No critical failure; displayed values match verified results |
| 9 | Deployment | Can it be put into practice? | Report and/or dashboard; rollout plan when relevant | Rendered, inspected, findings visible in the artifact itself |
| 10 | Feedback | What do users and outcomes tell us? | Feedback log; outcome review plan, marked pending | Feedback is not invented; revisited stages re-verified |

"Modeling" means whatever answers the question — often a well-chosen aggregation or comparison. Machine learning is optional and stays at analyst level (baselines, linear/logistic models).

## When the main question cannot be answered

Say so early and precisely (which linkage, timing, field or outcome is missing), then **pivot to the most valuable question the data can answer** that still serves the original purpose, and deliver that analysis properly. A feasibility verdict alone is a thin result; a feasibility verdict plus a real, related finding is useful. Label the pivot and the resulting status (partial analysis against the original aim). Never fabricate targets, timestamps or records to keep the original question alive.

## Integrity checklist

These protect the answer. Apply them silently; mention them in the report only where they change a conclusion.

- Inspect actual records and dictionaries before trusting a field's meaning. Preserve raw inputs.
- Define every metric by population, numerator/denominator, unit and window. Distinguish zero, missing and undefined.
- Validate join cardinality and reconcile control totals before aggregating.
- Respect time: no future information in features, account for censoring and incomplete periods.
- Respect design: survey weights, clustering, repeated observations of the same entity.
- Prefer distributions and comparisons over lone averages. Add uncertainty where inference is claimed; full-population totals do not need fake confidence intervals.
- Separate observation from interpretation. Associations are not causes without an identification strategy.
- Document material exclusions, deduplication and imputation with affected counts.
- Recompute decision-critical numbers independently. A check passes only when its stated condition was actually evaluated.
- Report status honestly: **complete analysis**, **partial analysis**, **feasibility assessment** or **unverified work**, with scope.

## Writing the findings

Read [visualization and storytelling](./references/visualization-and-storytelling.md) before writing a substantial report, and look at [the example report](./references/example-report.md) for the target voice.

- **Lead with the answer.** The first paragraph states the main finding with its key number, the population and what it means for the reader.
- **Headlines are claims.** "Students who missed an assignment due by day 60 were about 3.3 times as likely to fail or withdraw by course end" beats "Assessment behavior analysis". Chart titles are claims too.
- **One finding per section**: claim → evidence (one chart or one small table) → what it means → one sentence on its main limit.
- **Caveats live once.** Put limitations in a dedicated section and next to the specific claim they weaken. Do not hedge every sentence.
- **Tables are evidence, not prose.** Keep the body to a few small tables with only the columns the claim needs. Move wide or exhaustive tables to an appendix or `results/`.
- **Plain words.** Explain technical metrics once in reader terms (e.g., what a precision of 60% means for a teacher's review list).
- **Recommend only what the evidence supports**, and say what would confirm it.

## Deliverables and files

For substantial work, default to this layout (adapt to the project's conventions or the user's requested location):

```text
<output>/
├── report.html        # finding-led report, built from assets/report-template.html
├── dashboard.html     # optional: when interactive exploration helps the reader
├── NOTES.md           # brief, decisions, check ledger, open issues — one file
├── code/              # scripts that reproduce every number
├── results/           # result tables (CSV) behind each finding
└── figures/           # charts (PNG + SVG)
```

Keep process records in the single `NOTES.md`. Do not produce separate process, quality-review or self-scoring files; the reader judges the work by the report, and reviewers judge it by the code and ledger. Default to a report for substantial written analysis; add a dashboard when the reader needs to filter or explore. For focused questions, answer inline.

## Bundled assets and scripts

Use these instead of writing from scratch; they encode the house style.

| File | Use |
| --- | --- |
| [assets/report-template.html](./assets/report-template.html) | Self-contained report page: summary box, key-number tiles, finding sections, limitations, appendix. Light/dark, print-friendly. |
| [assets/dashboard-template.html](./assets/dashboard-template.html) | Offline dashboard: embedded JSON data, filters, KPI tiles and dependency-free SVG bar/line/interval charts. |
| [scripts/chart_style.py](./scripts/chart_style.py) | Matplotlib house style: accessible palette, claim titles, direct labels, highlight-one-bar, PNG+SVG export. |
| [scripts/stats_helpers.py](./scripts/stats_helpers.py) | Wilson and difference-in-proportion intervals, (cluster) bootstrap, capacity/alert tables, calibration bins, weighted shares. |
| [scripts/profile_data.py](./scripts/profile_data.py) | Fast first look at CSV/TSV/Parquet files: types, nulls, distinct counts, candidate keys, duplicates → Markdown. |

Scripts need `pandas`, `numpy` and (for charts) `matplotlib`. Run `python scripts/<name>.py --help` for usage, or import them.

## Playbooks

Playbooks give the standard questions, charts and traps for common problem types. Read the matching one during Business Understanding.

| Problem | Playbook |
| --- | --- |
| Predict who is at risk early (dropout, churn, default, failure) | [Early warning](./playbooks/early-warning.md) |
| A metric moved — what changed and why | [Diagnose a change](./playbooks/diagnose-change.md) |
| Questionnaire or sampled survey data (weights, Likert items, country comparisons) | [Survey analysis](./playbooks/survey-analysis.md) |

## Reference routing

Load only what the current stage needs. Where a row names a companion skill, call the Skill tool with it when it is installed; it does the tool work, while this skill keeps the decisions and checks. If it is not installed, the reference is enough.
